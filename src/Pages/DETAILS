 Organize Your Project Structure
A portfolio website usually has a few key sections:

Home/About Me: Brief introduction.
Projects: Showcase the projects you've worked on.
Skills: Highlight your skills and tools.
Contact: Include contact information or a form.
You can create separate components for each section:

/src/components/Home.js
/src/components/Projects.js
/src/components/Skills.js
/src/components/Contact.js






An "About" page for your portfolio website should reflect your personality, expertise, and career aspirations. Here's a sample you can customize to fit your unique background as a software engineering student with interests in data science, machine learning, and web development:
