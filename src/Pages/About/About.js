              I'm <u>Aadit Yadav </u>, a passionate software engineering student
              with a keen interest in web development (Backend, Frontend), data
              science and machine learning. Currently, I'm honing my skills in

              technologies, and I'm constantly looking for opportunities to
              expand my knowledge. I'm excited about contributing to innovative
              projects and connecting with others in the tech
